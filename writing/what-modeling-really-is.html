    <h1>What Modeling Really Is (and Isn’t)</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Choosing states, laws, and solvers — and knowing where the map ends.
    </p>
    <p class="meta">
      By Haitao Xu · Draft for web.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      Modeling is not about drawing a complicated diagram or running a large
      simulation. It is about making disciplined choices: what information to
      keep, what to ignore, which laws to enforce, and how the resulting
      structure is allowed to fail. Everything else is decoration.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Models Are Not Miniature Realities</h2>
    <p>
      We sometimes slip into talking as if a “good model” is a small copy of
      the real world. Add enough terms, enough parameters, enough detail, and
      the model becomes “realistic”. This is comforting — and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      A model is not a shrunken universe. It is a carefully constructed
      <em>machine for answering a particular class of questions</em>. Outside
      that question class, it is allowed to be blind, wrong, or silent. In
      fact, it <em>must</em> be; otherwise we have not really made a model,
      only a vague wish for omniscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first responsibility of a modeler is therefore not to capture
      everything, but to decide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Which states</strong> are necessary and sufficient to describe the problem,</li>
      <li><strong>Which laws</strong> those states must obey, and</li>
      <li><strong>What kind of solver</strong> we will accept as an answer mechanism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Modeling as State Choice</h2>
    <p>
      In the Rᵀ–L–S language, the first move is always a choice of
      <em>state</em>. For a mechanical system, we might choose positions and
      velocities; for a tire, we might choose deformation gradients, internal
      variables for viscoelasticity, and temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      This choice is never neutral. It already contains a worldview:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If we ignore temperature, we are saying: “For the questions I care
        about, temperature does not matter.”
      </li>
      <li>
        If we smear cord behavior into an effective isotropic stiffness, we
        are saying: “I do not need to know what happens between cords,
        only how the laminate behaves as a whole.”
      </li>
      <li>
        If we keep only steady-state rolling and discard transients, we are
        saying: “I will not ask this model about startup and shutdown.”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Good modeling begins by making these statements explicit instead of
      pretending that “the model” is just there, pre-packaged. Every state
      choice is a cut through reality; clarity about the cut is more
      important than elegance of the equations that follow.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Laws vs. Fitting</h2>
    <p>
      Once states are chosen, we introduce <em>laws</em>: balance of
      momentum, constitutive relations, energy inequalities, evolution
      equations. This is the <code>L</code> layer in the Rᵀ–L–S picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, it is tempting to mix two very different activities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Writing down <strong>structure-preserving laws</strong> that express
        symmetry, conservation, and thermodynamic admissibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fitting <strong>flexible function approximators</strong> (neural
        networks, polynomials, splines) to data within that structure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first activity is modeling; the second is parameter estimation or
      system identification. Both are necessary, but they are not the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we forget this distinction, we start to expect that a
      good-enough fit is automatically a good model. It isn’t. A model must
      decide what is allowed and what is impossible before any data arrives.
      Data then tells us <em>where</em> we are in that admissible space,
      not what the space itself should have been.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Solvers Are Not Oracles</h2>
    <p>
      With states and laws in place, we still need a way to obtain answers.
      That is the <code>S</code> layer: numerical solvers, optimization
      routines, time steppers, neural operators, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is tempting to treat solvers as oracles: press “Run”, wait, and
      accept whatever comes out. But solvers are just algorithms with
      failure modes. A model is only meaningful if the solver’s behavior is
      structurally compatible with the laws and states we chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A time integrator that does not respect energy or dissipation
        constraints may converge numerically while violating thermodynamics.
      </li>
      <li>
        A contact algorithm that permits interpenetration at the discrete
        level is modeling a different physical system, whether we admit it
        or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        A neural network that fits boundary data but does not enforce
        internal balance laws is not solving a PDE; it is interpolating
        measurements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A responsible modeler asks not only “Did it converge?” but also
      “Is this class of solver admissible for the laws I claimed to enforce?”
    </p>

    <h2>5. What Modeling Is Not</h2>
    <p>
      Against this background, it becomes easier to say what modeling
      <em>isn’t</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is not dumping all available variables into a black-box fitter and
        hoping generalization will happen by magic.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is not decorating a report with colorful contour plots after the
        core design decisions are already locked in.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is not hiding arbitrary assumptions in default settings and
        calibration spreadsheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is not a competition to see who can run the largest or most complex model.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these can appear in competent engineering projects, but none of
      them define modeling. They are, at best, side effects.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Modeling as Structured Forgetting</h2>
    <p>
      A more honest description is that modeling is a disciplined form of
      <em>forgetting</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We forget microscopic details when we use continuum mechanics. We
      forget acoustic waves when we study quasi-static deformation. We
      forget every loading scenario except those that matter for the design
      question at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art lies in forgetting the right things for the right reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>State choices that match the scale and questions of interest,</li>
      <li>Laws that encode the non-negotiable parts of physics,</li>
      <li>Solvers that fail loudly when we step outside the model’s domain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When done well, this kind of selective forgetting makes problems
      clearer, not fuzzier. It allows us to see structure we would otherwise
      miss: stiffness architectures, admissible operating envelopes, and
      the relationship between geometry, material, and performance.
    </p>

    <h2>7. A Simple Checklist</h2>
    <p>
      In practice, a working model can be tested against a few simple
      questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>States:</strong> Can I write down, in one paragraph, what is
        included in the state and what is deliberately omitted?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Laws:</strong> Do I know which equations express physics
        (balance, thermodynamics) and which are empirical closures?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solvers:</strong> Do I know what kind of failure should
        happen when the model is used outside its domain?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Questions:</strong> Can I list the questions this model is
        allowed to answer — and those it is not?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If the answer to these is “yes”, we are modeling. If not, we are
      probably just computing.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Closing Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      What modeling really is, in the end, is a way of thinking. Equations,
      simulations, and data are important, but they sit downstream of a few
      structural decisions about state, law, and solver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering this does not make the work easier. It does, however,
      make it more honest. It turns models from collections of tricks into
      explicit, examinable structures — structures that can be tested,
      improved, and, when necessary, replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the real power of modeling: not to mimic reality, but to
      expose, in a controlled and limited way, the parts of reality that
      matter for the decisions we face.
