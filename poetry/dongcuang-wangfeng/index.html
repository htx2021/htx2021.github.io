  <h1>冬窗望枫</h1>

  <div class="poem-cn">
    <p>冻云噙雨过疏枝，谁把晶珠缀墨丝？</p>
    <p>半壁横斜凝泪影，一窗澄澈挂冰姿。</p>
    <p>偶从枯寂窥灵动，渐信空无孕妙奇。</p>
    <p>正是微光初渡处，万千星子欲垂时。</p>

    <p><em>Watching Maples Through a Winter Window</em></p>
    <p>
      Frozen clouds, rain held fast, pass sparse branches—<br />
      who strung crystal beads along threads of ink?<br />
      Across half the wall, slanted shadows congeal like tears;<br />
      within one window, clarity suspends a poise of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From barrenness, I chance upon a glimpse of life,<br />
      and come to trust: emptiness can bear the marvelous.<br />
      So let me gather all things in a glassbound realm,<br />
      and wait for dawnlight to discern what once had been.
    </p>

      深冬雨后，窗外高枫黑枝交错，晶珠悬挂其上。久视之，目光渐被雨珠牵引，枝影退为线条。

    <p class="note-en">
      After a winter rain, black branches of a tall maple cross outside my office window, beads of water hanging from them. With time, the eye begins to follow the droplets first, while the branches recede into mere lines.
